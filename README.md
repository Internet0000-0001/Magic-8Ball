# Magic-8Ball
I'm very new to coding and I use python 3. I wanted to make a automatic magic 8ball, after doing some research I found a version that seemed to work for the most part but I still had to put some information in. That is left bellow. My refined version is going to be in a file on its own. I think I'll also make one that will work by asking you if you'd like to reroll.

I'll have the innefficient version stored in a file called 7ball.py and the refined version in a file 8ball.py

I didn't like how much spaghetti was in the code, using systems seemed really unreasonable but reading it from the right angle allowed me to see the bare bones of what this project actually needs.
If anyone can tell me why systems would be better than my own version, please let me know in a comment (i think you can do that right?)
